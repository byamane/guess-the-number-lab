// Guess the Number Game Features

/** Allow the player to continually be prompted to enter their guess at the secret number until they guess correctly.
 
 * If the player has an incorrect guess, display an alert message that informs the player:
 
 * Whether their guess is too high or too low, andâ€¦
  
 * A list of all the previously guessed numbers (without showing the square brackets of an array).

 * If the player has guessed the secret number:
      * Display an alert message that congrats the player and informs them of how many guesses they took.
 
 * End the gameplay.*/
